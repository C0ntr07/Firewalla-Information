How to use an SD card as external storage in Firewalla Purple

Prepare partition and file system on a new SD card

NOTES:

    If you have an SD card with existing data on it, you can bypass this preparation part and go to the Mount SD card partition part directly.

    Only support micro size SD card, class 10 or above recommended

Identify SD card

After plugging the SD card into the slot on Firewalla Purple, check to see if it is detected by the system, where it should be recognized as "/dev/mmcblk1".

For example,

$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk1
Disk /dev/mmcblk1: 7.51 GiB, 8053063680 bytes, 15728640 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0xf50c8845

Create partition and file system

There are different needs to use an SD card as external storage in Firewalla.

- To increase available external storage space in Firewalla, we can use a Linux file system like "ext4".

# copy and paste following 4 commands
sudo parted -s /dev/mmcblk1 mklabel gpt
sudo parted -s /dev/mmcblk1 mkpart primary ext4 2 100%
sudo parted -s /dev/mmcblk1 align-check optimal 1
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk1p1

- To share files between Firewalla and other systems(like Windows, Mac, Mobile device), we need to use a more compatible file system like "fat32".

# copy and paste following 5 commands
sudo parted -s /dev/mmcblk1 mklabel gpt
sudo parted -s /dev/mmcblk1 mkpart primary fat32 2 100%
sudo parted -s /dev/mmcblk1 align-check optimal 1
\sudo apt install -y dosfstools
sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/mmcblk1p1

Mount SD card partition

For SD card prepared from the above steps, just mount "/dev/mmcblk1p1"

sudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt/

To do a quick check, 

mount | grep /mnt
df -h /mnt

NOTE1: If your SD card has existing data with multiple partitions, you would need to have some idea about the existing partition structure, and pick the right partition(/dev/mmcblk1p?) to mount.

$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk1

NOTE2: With default mount options, "/mnt" is owned and only writable by root, to enable user `pi` to write to it, please mount "/mnt" with the uid/gid of user `pi`(1000).

For example if you used fat32,

sudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt -o rw,uid=1000,gid=1000

if you used ext4,

sudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt
sudo chown 1000:1000 /mnt

NOTE3: Be noted that this mount is just temporary. To make it permanent upon reboot, you can add the mount command to the shell startup file as needed

echo "sudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt" >> ~/.bashrc
# - OR -
echo "sudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt -o rw,uid=1000,gid=1000" >> ~/.bashrc

WARN: Always do un-mount before un-plug the SD card to avoid potential data corruption.

sudo umount -R /mnt
